## Be sure to

- `npm run format`: Makes sure all the code in this repository is well-formatted
  (looks good).
- `npm run lint:ls`: Will lint the folder and file names in this repository to
  make sure they match the repo conventions.
- `npm run lint:md`: Will lint all of the Markdown files in this repository and
  let you know if there are any style mistakes to fix.
- `npm run spell-check`: Goes through all the files in this repository looking
  for words it doesn't recognize. Just because it says something is a mistake
  doesn't mean it is! It doesn't know every word in the world. You can add new
  correct words to the [./.cspell.json](./.cspell.json) file so they won't cause
  an error.
